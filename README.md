# JavascriptPigGame
This is a simple game with the following rules
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

This Application is a part of course by Jonas Schmedtann, where I re-implemented the UI using the SASS and CSS3 grid. Everything else is done watching the lectures from the course.
